## Project: Python - Everything is Object

Welcome to the repository for the **Python - Everything is Object** project. This project dives deep into the core principles of Python objects and their behavior, helping to understand the magic behind Python's object model.

---

## **Project Structure**

This project contains the following directories and files:

### **Directory**: `python-everything_is_object`

| File Name          | Description                                   |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `0-answer.txt`     | Name of the function to print the type of an object |
| `1-answer.txt`     | Function to get the variable identifier (memory address) |
| `2-answer.txt`     | Check if `a` and `b` point to the same object (example 1) |
| `3-answer.txt`     | Check if `a` and `b` point to the same object (example 2) |
| `...`              | And so on for all required files             |

Each file contains **one-line answers** to questions about Python's object behavior. For files like `19-copy_list.py`, Python code is provided to solve specific tasks.

## **How to Use**

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming.git
   ```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/python-everything_is_object
```

Open the files and fill them with the appropriate answers.
Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:

Understand Python's object model.
Differentiate between mutable and immutable objects.
Use Python's built-in functions (id, type, etc.) effectively.
Explain how Python handles object references, memory, and operations.
